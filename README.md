Express React Register Login Demo
=================================

Write tests for a RegisterForm which sends request to backend.

```
npm install -g babel-cli
npm install
npm start
```

Then visit <http://localhost:3000>.

Note
----

- You have to use `window.alert` instead of `alert`, in order to test it
- I have to use `setTimeout` to wait all async code complete
